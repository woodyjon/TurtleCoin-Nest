## Installation

[Windows](#windows) - [Mac](#mac) - [Linux](#linux)

### Windows

1. Go [here](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-wallet-go/releases) and download the latest release called **TurtleCoin-Nest-x.xx-Windows.zip**
2. Unzip the folder and launch **TurtleCoin-Nest.exe**. (Make sure you leave everything as is in the folder)

Important notes:

* Make sure *turtle-service.exe* is not running before you start *TurtleCoin-Nest*

### Mac

1. Go [here](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-wallet-go/releases) and download the latest release called **TurtleCoin-Nest-x.xx-Mac.zip**.
2. Unzip it and move the folder wherever you want or drag the application **TurtleCoin-Nest** into /Applications or any other folder.
3. Launch the application. (If your mac complains that the app comes from an unindentified developer and does not want to open it, just right-click (or ctrl-click) on the app, and choose open > open)

Important notes:

* The wallets you create or generate will be saved to your home folder. You can keep them there or move them wherever you want.
* Make sure *turtle-service* is not running before you start *TurtleCoin-Nest*.
* If you encounter crashes, open the activity monitor (in your app > utilities), and force quit *turtle-service* (if it is running) before opening a wallet.
* The log files will be saved in ~/Library/Application Support/TurtleCoin-Nest/.

### Linux

1. Go [here](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-wallet-go/releases) and download the latest release called **TurtleCoin-Nest-x.xx-Linux.tar.gz**
2. extract it
`$ tar xvzf TurtleCoin-Nest-x.xx-Linux.tar.gz`
3. run **TurtleCoin-Nest.sh**. (Make sure you leave everything as is in the folder)

Important notes:

* Make sure *turtle-service* is not running before you start *TurtleCoin-Nest*
* If you want the *copy address to clipboard* button to work, install *xclip* or *xsel* (on Debian/Ubuntu: `$ sudo apt install xclip`).
* If you encounter crashes, open an activity monitor (e.g. `$ htop`), and quit *turtle-service* (if it is running) before opening a wallet. (this bug is being worked on)

## Upgrade
